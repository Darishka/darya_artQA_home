What’s in the toy box?
What’s in the box?
What’s in the box
With the big brass locks?

There’s a one-eyed ted
And a ball that’s red,
Some building bricks
And a clock that ticks,
A plastic boat
And a duck that floats,
A wind-up car
And a silver star,
A doll that cries
And a plane that flies.

That’s what’s in the toy box!
That’s what’s in the box!
